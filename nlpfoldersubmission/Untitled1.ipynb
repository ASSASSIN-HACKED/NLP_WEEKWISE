       "' Fellow - Countrymen : At this second appearing to take the oath of the Presidential office there is less occasion for an extended address than there was at the first . Then a statement somewhat in detail of a course to be pursued seemed fitting and proper . Now , at the expiration of four years , during which public declarations have been constantly called forth on every point and phase of the great contest which still absorbs the attention and engrosses the energies of the nation , little that is new could be presented . The progress of our arms , upon which all else chiefly depends , is as well known to the public as to myself , and it is , I trust , reasonably satisfactory and encouraging to all . With high hope for the future , no prediction in regard to it is ventured . On the occasion corresponding to this four years ago all thoughts were anxiously directed to an impending civil war . All dreaded it all sought to avert it . While the inaugural address was being delivered from this place , devoted altogether to saving the Union without war , urgent agents were in the city seeking to destroy it without war -- seeking to dissolve the Union and divide effects by negotiation . Both parties deprecated war , but one of them would make war rather than let the nation survive , and the other would accept war rather than let it perish , and the war came . One - eighth of the whole population were colored slaves , not distributed generally over the Union , but localized in the southern part of it . These slaves constituted a peculiar and powerful interest . All knew that this interest was somehow the cause of the war . To strengthen , perpetuate , and extend this interest was the object for which the insurgents would rend the Union even by war , while the Government claimed no right to do more than to restrict the territorial enlargement of it . Neither party expected for the war the magnitude or the duration which it has already attained . Neither anticipated that the cause of the conflict might cease with or even before the conflict itself should cease . Each looked for an easier triumph , and a result less fundamental and astounding . Both read the same Bible and pray to the same God , and each invokes His aid against the other . It may seem strange that any men should dare to ask a just God \\' s assistance in wringing their bread from the sweat of other men \\' s faces , but let us judge not , that we be not judged . The prayers of both could not be answered . That of neither has been answered fully . The Almighty has His own purposes . \" Woe unto the world because of offenses ; for it must needs be that offenses come , but woe to that man by whom the offense cometh .\" If we shall suppose that American slavery is one of those offenses which , in the providence of God , must needs come , but which , having continued through His appointed time , He now wills to remove , and that He gives to both North and South this terrible war as the woe due to those by whom the offense came , shall we discern therein any departure from those divine attributes which the believers in a living God always ascribe to Him ? Fondly do we hope , fervently do we pray , that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away . Yet , if God wills that it continue until all the wealth piled by the bondsman \\' s two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk , and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword , as was said three thousand years ago , so still it must be said \" the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether .\" With malice toward none , with charity for all , with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right , let us strive on to finish the work we are in , to bind up the nation \\' s wounds , to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan , to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations .'"
